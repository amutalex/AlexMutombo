I’m an IT professional with a strong foundation in networking, cloud, and automation. My journey began in networking, where I gained hands-on experience deploying and supporting enterprise systems. As my career evolved, I expanded into Azure Cloud to design and manage scalable infrastructure. Along the way, I developed skills in Python and PowerShell to automate processes, streamline operations, and improve efficiency.

I’m passionate about bridging the gap between networking and cloud technologies while continuously learning and building practical solutions.
